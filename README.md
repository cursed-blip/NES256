# NES256
NES256 (New Encryption Standard 256) is an educational, AES-inspired block cipher designed for learning and experimentation. It uses a 256-bit key, 128-bit blocks, AES-style rounds with SubBytes/ShiftRows/MixColumns, CTR mode for encryption, and HMAC-SHA256 for integrity. NES256 demonstrates modern encryption concepts and authenticated encryption.
