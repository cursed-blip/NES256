# NES256

**NES256 (New Encryption Standard 256)** is an educational, AES-inspired block cipher crafted for learning, experimentation, and small-scale applications. It features a 256-bit key, 128-bit block size, and AES-style rounds with SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns transformations, providing strong diffusion and confusion characteristics. 

NES256 uses **CTR mode** for encryption combined with **HMAC-SHA256** for authentication, demonstrating modern principles of authenticated encryption in a compact and approachable implementation. While NES256 is suitable for educational purposes and small business projects, it is not formally audited for high-security environments, so it should **not** be relied upon for sensitive or high-value data. 

i will update this probably if it gets some stars and etc..
if needed help with anything dm @closetcheater67 on discord!
